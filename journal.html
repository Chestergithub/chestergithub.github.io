    <p>"Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity.: " I definitely won't be passing any cars. June 2, 2012 My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cellphone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."</p>
